# Description:
- This is a MEAN stack web application(built using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js).
- Mongodb datbase is used for teachers, students and marksheets data storage.
- Express.js is used for making interaction between the database and the application.
- Angular.js is used for front-end part of the application.
- Node.js is used for API creation.

# Working of the application:
1. There are two options on home page for the user to select their portal one for Teacher and the other for Student.

![select portal](https://github.com/diwakarsharma4/School-Marksheet-Management-MEAN-Stack-App/assets/101266746/ac753605-3119-4c55-9862-8d6d1ea19096)

Let's start with the Teacher portal.

2. A teacher can login and if they are new to app they can register themself. In case login credentials could not match any existing data then user will be redirected to register page.

3. After successful login, the teacher will be redirected to marksheets list page where all the existing data will be displayed.

![teacher welcome](https://github.com/diwakarsharma4/School-Marksheet-Management-MEAN-Stack-App/assets/101266746/c383c1f8-8ea3-425b-b251-b1779ad49ed1)

4. Teacher can perform CRUD operations of marksheet data, hence they can add new record, update existing record and delete existing record.

Now let's start with the student portal.

5. A student can login and if they are new to app they can register themself. In case login credentials could not match any existing data then user will be redirected to register page.

![student login](https://github.com/diwakarsharma4/School-Marksheet-Management-MEAN-Stack-App/assets/101266746/64c7c071-77ce-48a1-81de-976d194382ff)

6. after successful login, the student will be redirected to marksheet search page where they can provide students' credentials to search their marksheet.
